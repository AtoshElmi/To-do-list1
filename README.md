# To-Do List Application

A simple and modern to-do list app that allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as complete, filter tasks by status, and clear completed tasks. The tasks are stored in `localStorage` so they persist even after a page reload.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Toggle Completion**: Users can mark tasks as completed or active by checking/unchecking the checkboxes.
- **Filters**: Users can filter tasks by:
  - **All Tasks**: Show all tasks.
  - **Active Tasks**: Show only tasks that are not completed.
  - **Completed Tasks**: Show only tasks that are completed.
- **Clear Completed**: Clear all completed tasks from the list.
- **Persistence**: Tasks are saved to `localStorage` to persist even after refreshing the page.
